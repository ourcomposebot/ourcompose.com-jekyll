    "content": "This post goes into detail the shelving of the OurCompose Project. It encompasses some final thoughts on the project.\n\nMajor Thoughts (from Jack):\n\nWhat’s the most important part of every joke? Timing\n\nWell.. Maybe if this were mid-2000’s or Early 2010’s there would be a different story. \nThere are a few projects that already exist within the space that are struggling in the same ways we are. \nFortunately or Unfortunately, some of these projects have packed up in search for better things because they stumbled into the same results we did.\nOr I should say, we stumbled into the same results they did.\n\nResults Driven?\n\nNo. We never monetized from the beginning focusing on paying customers. I guess looking back we were results driven towards our own results, instead of customer’s results.\n\n“Do things that don’t scale.” -&gt; I think we went out and quite literally did the exact opposite. We built something that could scale. (You can put a star by that statement, but given the correct number of signups for the paid service, we could have scaled with ease. Expanding instances may have been a different story, but still..)\n\n10x better for the Customer to Move\n\nUnfortunately, we were still working towards feature parity with some of the major services.\n\nPaaS/IaaS/SaaS is getting to be a bloated and oversaturated market.\n\nIt is hard to compete in a market already dominated by major/medium sized players.\n\n“You have to be 10 times better than second best.” - Peter Thiel\n\nIt would have taken us moving a mountain to get to 10x the second best. Teams of engineers are working towards enterprise solutions in the cloud space.\n\nThe Project From Here\n\nThe project/collection/portal/commandcenter are all MIT Licensed. They won’t be going anywhere.\n\nSupport will likely be on an as requested basis via gitlab issues.\n\nWhere do you go from here?\n\nEvaluation first, then action.\n\n",

The book appeared on Time magazine’s list of 100 all-time best English-language novels written since 1923.\n\nSummary\n\n\n  Not-too-distant future - a world where the Mafia controls pizza delivery, the United States exists as a patchwork of corporate-franchise city-states, and the Internet - incarnate as the Metaverse - looks something like last year’s hype would lead you to believe it should.\n\n  In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for the CosaNostra.\nBut in the Metaverse, he’s a warrior prince, last of the solo hackers, and the greatest sword fighter in the world.\nNow, he’s racing along the neon-lit streets, the skirts of his black leather kimono flapping, on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse!\nWhen his best friend fries his brain on a new designer drug called Snow Crash and his beautiful, brainy ex-girlfriend asks for his help, what’s a guy with a name like that to do? He rushes to the rescue.\n\n\n\n  Similar to Cyber(bug) 2077, most territory is owned by private organizations and entrepreneurs.\n  The main character is “Hiro Protagonist” who is a pizza delivery boy by day, and the originator of the Metaverse at night.\n  His friend receives a letter (in the metaverse) that causes his computer to crash and suffer brain damage in the real world.\n  He has to find the origins of this virus and stop the evil men from using it for evil.\n\n\nEconomics\n\n\n  Hyperinflation has sapped the value of the US dollar to the extent that trillion-dollar bills—Ed Meeses—are nearly disregarded, and the quadrillion-dollar note—the Gipper—is the standard “small” bill.\n This hyperinflation was created by the government overprinting money, due to loss of tax revenue, as people increasingly began to use electronic currency, which they exchanged in untaxable encrypted online transactions.\n For physical transactions, most people resort to alternative currencies such as yen or “Kongbucks” (the official currency of Mr. Lee’s Greater Hong Kong).\n Hyperinflation has also negatively affected much of the rest of the world (with some exceptions like Japan), resulting in waves of desperate refugees from Asia, who cross the Pacific in rickety ships hoping to arrive in North America.\n\n\nMetaverse\n\n\n  The Metaverse, a phrase coined by Stephenson as a successor to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson’s vision of how a virtual reality–based Internet might evolve in the near future.\nResembling a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), the Metaverse is populated by user-controlled avatars, as well as system daemons.\nAlthough there are public-access Metaverse terminals in Reality, using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse denizens, in part because of the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality avatars.\nStatus in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one’s avatar.\n\n\nReady Player One\n\n\n  In the year 2045, the world is gripped by an energy crisis and global warming, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation.\nThe primary escape for most people is a virtual universe called the OASIS, which is accessed with a visor and haptic gloves.\nIt functions both as an MMORPG and as a virtual society, with its currency being the most stable currency in the world.\n\n\nSimilar Metaverse Games\n\n\n  IMVU (as discussed in Episode #11’s Grab Bag - The Lean Startup)\n  Second Life\n  Facebook’s Metaverse\n\n\nNFTs\n\n\n  What Are NFTs and How Can They Be Used in Decentralized Finance? DEFI Explained\n\n\nAren’t they basically just JPEGs you can right-click save?\n\n\n  Not all NFTs are stored in the same way.\nOne of the main features of NFTs is their provable ownership, verifiability and provenance.\nAs we know this is achieved by creating NFTs on Decentralized Blockchains such as Ethereum, but here comes a problem.\nAlthough the beautiful, high-resolution pictures of apes or penguins are cool, there is no way the image files representing them can be stored on the blockchain itself.\nThis leads to a situation when most NFTs only include a link to the actual art and its metadata which is then stored off-chain.\n\n  There is a whole range of options when storing data off-chain.\nSome projects use centralized servers, others try to improve the situation by uploading their metadata and art to IPFS.\nOther solutions like Arweave are also gaining traction.\n\n  Generative art and certain low-resolution NFTs are some of the exceptions here as they can be entirely stored on-chain.\n– NFT Mania - Hype Or A New Paradigm? CryptoPunks, BAYC, Generative Art, Loot Explained\n\n\nPFP NFTs\n\n\n  The first NFT collection that started the PFP trend is the Crypto Punks.\nOwners of a Punk put up their precious NFT that only contained a few pixels up as their avatar on Twitter.\nWhile in the meantime creating a pseudonymous identity online.\nA digital identity, without your real face, and sometimes without your real name.\nBut under which you can freely post your opinion and engage in conversations online.\n\n  While this is great and all, can’t people just save your image and use it as their Twitter profile pic?\nWell yes, they can. But since NFTs are on the blockchain, it’s easy to prove who is the original owner.\n\n  Moreover, Twitter developers announced that they are working on a verification tool, so Twitter can verify ownership of the NFT.\nThe owner will get a small Ethereum logo on their PFP, similar to the blue checkmark icon that influencers have.\n\n  This way, everyone can spot with the naked eye if the social media account truly owns the NFT.\n– Profile Picture / PFP NFTs – All You Need to Know\n\n\nNFTs need a social, digital marketplace\n\n\n  But which blockchain?\nThere are many blockchains.\nWhat is to prevent someone from uploading the same NFT on multiple blockchains (less of an issue for now because Ethereum seems to run all the NFTs)?\nWhat is to prevent someone, once having uploaded an NFT on a given blockchain, to promise not to upload anymore copies, but then to break the promise and, in effect, increase the print run?\n\n\n\n  We have no technological guarantees that Dorsey’s genesis tweet will not be retokenized by him as an NFT.\nInstead, the only constraint on proliferation is Dorsey’s promise not to do otherwise and the social norms that would hold him to that promise.\n\n\n\n  Unless my signing over of the digital photo on the Ethereum blockchain is combined with a parallel signing over of actual copyright in the real marketplace of our society at large, all you can do is negotiate/trade this digital photo (i.e., NFT) on the blockchain where it was uploaded and signed over to you.\nSo you’re in effect stuck on the blockchain where the NFT resides.\nPerhaps laws will at some point be changed so that points of sale in the virtual marketplace of the Ethereum blockchain are treated as points of sale in the real marketplace of the society at large, conferring all the rights and guarantees of the real marketplace.\nBut that’s not the case now, and there’s no prospect for that becoming the case anytime soon.\n\n\n\n  Having saturated Rarible with my NFT of the Iowa Democratic Primary, I could go to any other NFT marketplace that requires no prior approval of its users, and do the same exercise there, uploading the png of the Iowa Democratic Primary there as an NFT.\nGranted, word of my unbridled proliferation of the same NFT might get around and ruin any chance of turning a profit with it.\nBut that’s not the point.\n\n  The point is that such unbridled proliferation, with its assault on scarcity, has no technological solution.\n\n\n\n  As a consequence, all the actual content of an NFT—in other words, what makes it collectible, artworthy, or of any interest—will typically reside off the Etherium blockchain.\nBut where?\nIn the case of the NFT I created at Rarible, it will reside (big surprise) at Rarible, with what’s on the Ethereium blockchain simply registering the NFT and pointing to Rarible for the png that’s at the heart of this NFT.\n\n  So my NFT, to exist at all, must reside in two places, namely, the Ethereum blockchain AND the Rarible website. If either fails, I lose my NFT.\n\n\n\n  That it was signed over to him on the Ethereium blockchain, or any blockchain for that matter, seems unessential.\nChristie’s and Sundaresan, for instance, could each have set up a private/public cryptographic key for themselves, and Christie’s could then have signed over Everydays from its key to Sundaresan’s.\nThe public keys and the signing over of the artwork using private keys would have been noted far and wide given all the public attention to this sale, and Sundaresan could have paid for it in any currency mutually agreed upon by the buyer and auction house.\nBlockchain could thus have been sidelined.\n\n\n\n  ownership on the Ethereum blockchain is not ownership in the real world.\nReal world ownership is ownership with the force of law behind it.\nEthereum blockchain-based ownership is purely conventional ownership.\nIt applies only within the Ethereum ecosystem, and nowhere outside.\n\n\n– How Non-Fungible Tokens Work: NFTs Explained, Debunked, and Legitimized\n\nTL;DR\n\nNFTs are legitimized to the extent that their utilization is confined to a socially-defined ecosystem whose rules are centrally enforced.\n",

(symptom oriented)\n\nBenefits of Monitoring:\n\n  Analyzing long-term trends\n  Comparing over time or experiment groups\n  Alerting\n  Building Dashboards\n  Ad hoc retrospective analysis (debugging)\n\n\nMonitoring should address two questions: what’s broken, and why?\n\nThe “what’s broken” indicates the symptom; the “why” indicates a (possibly intermediate) cause.\n\n“What” versus “why” is one of the most important distinctions in writing good monitoring with maximum signal and minimum noise.\n\nThe Four Golden Signals of Monitoring:\n\n  Latency - the time it takes to service a request\n  Traffic - A measure of how much demand is being placed on a system, measured in a high-level system-specific metric\n  Errors - The rate of requests that fail, either explicitly, implicitly, or by policy\n  Saturation - how “full” your service is.\n\n\nIf you measure all four golden signals and page a human when one signal is problematic (or, in the case of saturation, nearly problematic, your service will be at least decently covered by monitoring.\n\nWorrying about your tail:\n\n  It’s tempting to design a system based upon the mean of some quantity: the mean latency, the mean CPU usage of your nodes, or the mean fullness of your databases, but this presents a problem. If you run a web service with an average latency of 100 ms at 1,000 requests per second, 1% of requests might easily take 5 seconds.23 If your users depend on several such web services to render their page, the 99th percentile of one backend can easily become the median response of your frontend.\n\n\nPiling requirements on top of each other can add up to a very complex system. \nThe sources of potential complexity are never-ending. \nLike all software systems, monitoring can become so complex that it’s fragile, complicated to change, and a maintenance burden.\n\n",

As a result, at the crucial moment, when it is most important to be convincing, nine out of ten times we are not. Our most important messages have a suprisingly low chance of getting through.\n\n\n\n  As it turns out, pitching is one of those business skills that depends heavily on the method you use and not how hard you try.\n\n\n\n  Our secret sauce is such-and-such technology. No, that’s not a secret sauce. That’s ketchup.\n\n\nYou have to own the room with Frame Control, drive emotions with intrigue pings and get to a hookpoint faily quickly.\n\nIntrigue Ping - short but provactive piece of information that arouses curiosity\nHookpoint - the place in the presentation where your listeners become emotionally engaged (instead of giving information, they are asking you for more on their own.)\n\n\n  If you have been in business for more than 10 minutes, you have figured this much out: The better you are at keeping someone’s attention, the more likely the person will be to go for your idea.\n\n\n\n  But what kind of advice is this really? Telling someone, “Keep the audience’s attention” is like telling someone learning to play tennis to “hit the ball with topspin when it comes.” They know that!\n\n\nOur brain developed in three separate stages:\n\n  Crocodile Brain: responsible for the initial filtering of all incoming messages, it generates most survival fight-or-flight responses, and it produces strong, basic emotions\n  Mid-Brain: determines the meaning of things and social situations\n  Neocortex: evolved with a problem-solving ability and is able to think about complex issues and produce answers using reason.\n\n\nPitches are sent from the modern—and smart—part of the brain: the neocortex. But they are received by a part of the brain that is 5 million years older (and not as bright.)\n\nStrong Acronym: \nS - Setting the Frame \nT - Telling the story \nR - Revealing the intrigue \nO - Offering the prize \nN - Nailing the hookpoint \nG - Getting a decision \n\nAs I mentioned before, no situation has real meaning until you frame it.\n\nPeople are always trying to impose frames on each other. The frame is like a picture of what you want the interaction to be about. And the most powerful thing about frames? There can be only one dominant frame during any interaction between two people.\n\nGoing into most business situations, there are three major types of opposing frames that you wil encounter:\n\n  Power frame\n  Time frame\n  Analyst frame\n\n\n\nYou have three major response frame types that you can use to meet these oncoming frames, win the initial col ision, and control the agenda:\n\n\n  Power-busting frame\n  Time constraining frame\n  Intrigue frame\nThere is a fourth frame you can deploy. It’s useful against al three of the opposing frames and many others you wil encounter: 4. Prize frame\n\n\nDifferent Frames:\n\n  The Power Frame: a status derived from the fact that others give this person honor and respect\n  The Time Frame:Time frames are often used by your Target to rechal enge your frame by disrupting you and, in the moment of confusion, unwittingly take back control.\n  The Intrigue Frame/Analyst Frame: How many times have you been giving a presentation when suddenly one or more people in the room take a deep dive into technical details? That’s the Analyst Frame\n  Prizing Frame: Prizing is a way to deal with threatening and fast-approaching frames that are likely to push you into a low-status position. Prize correctly and your target will be chasing you.\n\n\nPrizing:\nLet’s consider three of the most fundamental behaviors of human beings:\n\n  We chase that which moves away from us.\n  We want what we cannot have.\n  We only place value on things that are difficult to obtain.\n\n\nYou’re going to make the pitch in four sections or phases:\n\n  Introduce yourself and the big idea: 5 minutes.\n    \n      Start with a track record of success.\n      It’s vitally important that the target knows that your idea is new, emerging from current market opportunities and that it’s not some relic left over from bygone days\n    \n  \n  Explain the budget and secret sauce: 10 minutes.\n    \n      In phase 2, it gets harder to hold the target’s attention. Now you have to explain what problems the big idea real y solves and how it actual y works. The opportunities to scare the croc brain seriously multiply when you start to explain how stuff works.\n    \n  \n  Offer the deal: 2 minutes.\n    \n      In phase 2, it gets harder to hold the target’s attention. Now you have to explain what problems the big idea real y solves and how it actual y works. The opportunities to scare the croc brain seriously multiply when you start to explain how stuff works.\n    \n  \n  Stack frames for a hot cognition: 3 minutes.\n    \n      Deciding that you like something before you fully understand it—that’s a hot cognition.\n    \n  \n\n\nIn the end basically it boils down to telling a story that breaks down the analytical mindset, to keep the target intrigued and interested in what you have to say, to win respect so that they want you rather than the other way around, to get them emotionally engaged, and to get the deal at the end of your meeting.\n\nSo it’s not enough to be smart, or even to be right. In the end, what matters is how you get your point across to the other person. And there is a lot more to it than you think.\n\n",

Below the line lies excuse making, blaming others, confusion, and an attitude of helplessness, while above that line lies a sense of reality, ownership, commitment, solutions to problems, and determined action.\n\nAbove the line:\n\nSee it, Own it, Solve it, Do it\n\nBelow the line:\n\nIgnore/Deny, It’s not my job, finger pointing, confusion and tell me what to do, cover your tail, wait and sit\n\nPeople and Organizations find themselves thinking and behaving below the line whenever they consciously or uncounsciously avoid accountability for individual or collective results.\n\nPart 1: The Oz Principle: Getting Results Through Accountability\n\nLike all powerful literature, The Wizard of Oz continues to enthrall audiences because its plot strikes a nerve in people. The book recounts a journey toward awareness, and, from the beginning of their journey, the story’s main characters gradually learn that they possess the power within themselves to get the results they want. Until the end, they think of themselves as victims of circumstance, skipping down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the supposedly all-powerful Wizard will grant them the wisdom, heart, courage, and means to succeed. The journey itself empowers them, and even Dorothy, who could have clicked her red slippers and returned home at any time, must travel the yellow brick road to gain full awareness that only she herself can achieve her desires. People relate to the theme of a journey from ignorance to knowledge, from fear to courage, from insensitivity to caring, from paralysis to powerfulness, from victimization to accountability, because it seems so true. Unfortunately, even the most ardent admirers of the story often fail to learn its simple lesson, never getting off the yellow brick road, blaming others for their circumstances, and waiting for wizards to wave their magic wands and make all the problems disappear.\n\nIn fact, the temptation to feel and act like victims has become so popular in America that it has created a very real crisis.\n\nThe majority of people in organizations today, when confronted with poor performance or unsatisfactory results, immediately begin to formulate excuses, rationalizations, and arguments for why they cannot be held accountable, or, at least, not fully accountable for the problems.\n\nThe latest, most up-to-date management concepts and techniques won’t help if you’ve neglected the basic principles that empower people and organizations to turn in exceptional performances.\n\nVictimization vs Accountability\n\nThe greatest destruction visited upon our society by the current cult of victimization stems from its subtle dogma that people cannot become what they desire to become because of their circumstance.\n\nIn essence, this attitude of victimization prevents a person from growing and developing.\n\nIn fact, many people in American organizations, wanting to feel good about themselves when results don’t materialize, would rather offer excuses for why they didn’t get the expected results than find ways to overcome the obstacles keeping them from those results.\n\nPeople tend to remain in the victim cycle because they find certain comforting, if not self-defeating, rewards below-the-line. Such rewards include “I dont have to admit I was wrong”, “I wont lose face”, I dont have to do anything differently in the future” and “I can justify my lack of performance and growth.”\n\nThose obsessed with the past are ignorant of the future.\n\nPart 2: The Power of Individual Accountability: Moving yourself above the line\n\nSee it- involves recognizing and and acknowledging the full reality of a situation (hardest step/greatest hurdle because it’s so hard to undertake an honest self-appraisal and acknowledge that you can do more to get results)\n\nOwn it- means accepting responsibility for the experiences and realities you create for yourself and others. (this step paves the road to action)\n\nSolve it- entails changing reality by finding and implementing solutions to problems that you may not have thought of before, while avoiding the trap of falling below the line\n\nDo it- entails mustering the commitment and courage to follow-through with the solutions you have identified, even if those solutions involve a lot of risk.\n\nSuccess in business boils down to one simple principle: you can either get stuck or get results. Period. Case Closed.\n\nPart 3: Results Through Collective Accountability: Helping Your Organization Perform Above the Line\n\n\n  You can be sure our plan was perfect - it’s just that the assumptions were wrong.\n\n",

Learn to trust in your ability to respond to unpredictable events; it’s more important than trusting in your ability to plan for disaster.\n\n\nAgile Manifesto:\n\n\n  Manifesto for Agile Software Development\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:\n\n  \n    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n    Working software over comprehensive documentation\n    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n    Responding to change over following a plan\n  \n\n  That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\n\n\nPrinciples Behind the Manifesto:\n\n\n  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n\n  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\n\n  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n\n  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n\n  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n\n  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n\n  Working software is the primary measure of progress.\n\n  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\n  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n\n  Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.\n\n  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\n  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\n\nIs the Agile Manifesto Still a thing?\n\nWhen something as culturally important as the Manifesto comes along, you might be able to reinterpret it, but there’s nothing quite like the original. So, instead of trying to officially update it, maybe it’s best to figure out how to apply it to yourself, your team, or your organization.\n\n“In a lot of ways, the Manifesto is a basis of a conversation,” Wortham said. “Here’s how I interpret it. How do you interpret it? All right, let’s figure out how to work together.”\n\nIn that vein, perhaps what’s important isn’t one blessed document that everyone can agree on, but whether or not a group of people (from a team to an entire organization) can apply the ideas in the Manifesto to their specific situation without losing sight of its spirit. And if we can do that well, the possibilities are unlimited.\n\n“I think if we do it right, the world is in a position to be amazing. We can solve cancer. My children will probably live to be 150, to 175,” West said. “I think that we can do it, and I think that we will.”\n",

so that .\"_\n        \n      \n      Time-Boxed Iterations\n    \n  \n  Kanban is a method for changing and improving a team’s process\n    \n      Start with what you’re doing now\n        \n          Evolve using small incremental changes based on experimentation and data\n        \n      \n      Set WIP limits for each stage in the process\n        \n          Detect when the workflow is overloaded and make adjustments to address the constraints that are the root cause of the overload.\n        \n      \n      Establish a pull system based on kanban signals\n        \n          Teams self-organize around available cycles and self-assign tasks\n          “Just as an unregulated index card on a cork board is not a kanban, time-boxed iteration planning is not pull”\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhat actually changes?\n\n\n  Team members use Kanban utilize systems thinking to analyze and understand their workflows.\n\n\nOptimize Flow\n\n\n  Kanban’s visualization tools provide transparency that exposes “bottlenecks, queues, variability and waste”\n\n\nMetrics can expose where the system is overloaded but the team has not discovered the source of the problem.\n\n\n  Lead Time\n    \n      Concept to Cash\n    \n  \n  Cycle Time\n    \n      Hands on keyboard\n    \n  \n  WIP Limits\n    \n      Task Count\n      Complexity\n      Story Points\n      Time Tracking\n    \n  \n  Throughput\n    \n      Improvement over time\n      Performance Reality\n      Stability of workflow\n      Predictable Process\n    \n  \n\n\nIf the product owner can show the stakeholders that this new rule could lead to faster development, and lower lead times, stakeholders will be happy to accept their decisions.\nAlternatively, if lead times do NOT decrease, the experiment could be perceived as a hindrance rather than a boon.\nRemember, these metrics are only useful if they translate into a perceived faster development turnaround.\n\nBetter Backlog Management\n\nA perfect example of an ever-growing product backlog issue can be found in: Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell\n\nA very easy fix for a feeling of being overloaded and facing increasing pressure to multitask and cut corners, is to visualize where the work is piling up.\nAdding a pre-backlog “Feature Requests” column will expose that more feature requests are coming in than can be handled by the team.\nThis is a problem that can be addressed at the Product Owner level - saying “no” to additional work to meet the constraints of the new column.\nAdjusting the WIP limit up or down based on experience will help to find the optimal limit that leads to the lowest average lead time per story.\nA “Rejected” column is optional if it helps communicate to stakeholders better when it’s visualized.\n\nThis is also known as “Level 2 Scrumban”\n\n\n  Once you’ve broken up the timebox, you can start to get leaner about the construction of the backlog.\nAgility implies an ability to respond to demand.\nThe backlog should reflect the current understanding of business circumstances as often as possible.\nIn other words, the backlog should be event-driven.\nTimeboxed backlog planning is just that, where the event is a timer, and once we see it that way, we can imagine other sorts of events that allow us to respond more quickly to emerging priorities.\nSince our system already demonstrates pull and flow, that increased responsiveness should come at no cost to our current efficiency.\n\n\nCommon Misconceptions About Scrumban\n\nScrumban is simply a tool to organize work and make it more efficient\n\n\n  Scrum is focused on project management and product delivery; Kanban is focused on process improvement\n\n\nIf Scrumban is adopted because a team is overloaded, it is likely to succeed in changing the way [the team] works, but unlikely to fix the problems that caused the overload.\n\n\n  After the evolution stops, [the team] is no longer following Kanban or any other method for improvement.\n\n\nScrumban is essentially “Iteration-less” Scrum\n\n\n  Scrum teams are attracted to the idea of Scrumban because it provides a convenient excuse to remove the “hard” part.\nIteration is not just a way to break projects up into phases; it is a tool for accountability, and that accountability can be uncomfortable.\nThis is one of the most important features of Scrum because it helps teams make decisions based on experience and actual, known facts from their projects.\n\n\nThings that need to happen with or without iterations:\n\n  Team demonstrates working software\n  Stakeholders refine requirements\n  Team reviews process obstacles\n  Team agrees on process improvements\n  Team agrees on what work to prioritize\n\n\nHow Scrumban teams can move beyond their misconceptions\n\nHow to replace iterations\n\nAn effective Scrumban implementation must include practices that provide the empirical process control benefits of iterations.\n\n\n  INCLUDE PRACTICES THAT PROVIDE THE EMPIRICAL PROCESS CONTROL BENEFITS OF ITERATIONS\n\n\n\n  Planning\n  Predictability\n  Accountability\n  Ceremonies for Reflection\n\n\n“Cadences” are triggered by milestones or external events rather than a time-boxed iteration.\nEach work item can be considered part of the reflection process, and no work item is considered complete until it’s been included in a retrospective.\n\nHow to implement process improvement\n\n\n  Step 1\n    \n      Start with what you do now\n      Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change\n      Initially, respect current roles, responsibilities, and job titles\n    \n  \n  Step 2\n    \n      Visualize the Workflow\n      Limit WIP\n      Manage Flow\n      Make Process Policies Explicit\n      Implement Feedback Loops\n      Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally\n    \n  \n\n",

After three years and millions of dollars later they didn’t bother looking at the process, but rather signed another contract with a contractor. Of course as defects arose, and when they were far behind they decided to look at a new approach to the project.\n\nScrum reduces the feedback cycle, and forces a continuous inspection and adaption cycle forcing the question “why” at every task verifying the need and/or how it can be improved.\n\nBasically Asking:\n\n  How can we work better?\n  What were the impedements that needed to be removed?\n  What is slowing us down?\n\n\nLessons great companies have\n\n\n  Multifunctional teams, with varied skills and experiences, with the autonomy to manage themselves;\n  Leaders focused on removing impedements to facilitate progress\n  Flexible and Fast development of projects in stages that increment\n  Clear Objective and Purpose for every member of the organization\n\n\n“A team has to demand greatness from itself.”\n\nOne Task at a time\n\nSomething that is half done isn’t done. It’s essentially all or nothing when it comes to tasks. You can’t have something that exists as 50% complete as complete.\n\nDo one thing exclusively before moving on to another project.\n\nDo It Right the First Time. When you make a mistake, fix it right away. Stop everything else and address it. Fixing it later can take you more than twenty times longer than if you fix it now.\n\nOnly Plan What You Need To. Don’t try to project everything out years in advance. Just plan enough to keep your team busy.\n\nIt has been proven humans are terrible at planning in hours.\n\nCommunication\n\nEveryone knows Everything. Communication saturation accelerates work.\n\nOne Meeting a Day. When it comes to team check-ins, once a day is enough. Get together for fifteen minutes at the Daily Stand-up, see what can be done to increase speed, and do it.\n\nRoles\n\nDevelopment Team: every team has members with the necessary skills to design, build, and test the product, and everyone participates in the development process from the beginning to the end. Teams are multifunctional.\n\nScrum Master: Someone familiar with the Scrum structure, acting as an advisor and as a facilitator, with the goal to help the team identify and deal with impedements that arise through the project.\n\nProduct Owner: in contact with the stakeholders, receiving opinions, and feedback from customers. Role exists to relay vision and decisions from customer point of view\n\nPriorities\n\nThe key is what you decide to do first:\n\n  Big impact?\n  Important to customer?\n  Make money?\n  Easiest to implement?\n\n\nAim for REVENUE first, figure out the 20% of input that yields 80% of the output.\n\nWhat is something that takes 20% to ship to the customer we can build the other 80% later?\n\nThinking most value for the least effort\n",

Rereading, on the other hand, has low utility because it is a passive exercise - just testing yourself once has been shown to be more effective than rereading the same passage four times.\n\n\n\n  Spaced Repetition\n  Active Recall\n  Active Recall and Spaced Repetition\n  What is Active Recall and Spaced Repetition\n  Anki\n\n",

Ended up fufilling the shipment after a visit from the project leader visited the location where the bronze is maid.\n\nPrinciple 1: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.\n\nHow to Criticize… and Not Be Hated for It\n\nCharles Schwab was walking a factory and two gentlmen were smoking under a no smoking sign. He handed them cigars and asked them to smoke them outside. They had known they had broken the rules.\n\nPrinciple 2: Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly\n\nTalk about your own mistakes first\n\nAdmitting your own mistakes can help convince somebody to change his behavior.\n\nPrinciple 3: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\n\nNo One Likes to Take Orders\n\nPrinciple 4: Ask questions instead of giving orders\n\nLet the Other Person Save Face\n\n“Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.”\n\nGE Example of Charles Steinmetz who was brilliant engineer, but terrible head of accounting department.\nThey ended up re-assigning him with a new title where he was happy and the officers of GE were happy. \nHe got to work with a new title for the work he was already doing, and the officers got to replace him with someone else to lead the department.\n\nEven if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone else to lose face.\n\nPrinciple 5: Let the other person save face\n\nHow To Spur People onto Success\n\nThe good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.\n\nWe all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.\n\n“Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. Im not advocating a bag of tricks. Im talking about a new way of life.”\n\nPrinciple 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”\n\nGive a Dog a Good Name\n\n“The average person can be lead readily if you have his or her respect and you show that person you respect that person for some kind of ability.”\n\nIn short, if you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.\n\nGive them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.\n\nPrinciple 7: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\n\nMake the fault seem easy to correct\n\nBasically there was this really bad kid that teachers really complained about. He was really smart, but picked fights. The fourth grade teacher pointed at him and made him responsible for being a leader in the class. She re-enforced this 3/4 times in the first few weeks and after that he was better in the class room. she enabled him to do better things and act more responsibly.\n\nPrinciple 8: Use Encouragement, Make the fault seem easy to correct.\n\nMaking people glad to do what you want\n\nExample of Woodrow Wilson picking his friend over someone more qualified to go overseas in an attempt to bring peace to Europe.\nBryan was disappointed when he heard he wasn’t going, but he was told “the President thought it would be unwise for anyone to do this officially, and that his going would attract a great deal of attention and people would wonder why he was there…”\n\nPear tree. Had his kid pick up every pear. Paid him $1 for every basket full, but took one away for every dollar on the ground.\n\nPrinciple 9: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest\n",

(opposite of important)\nYou have hurt his pride.\nHe will resent your triumph, and:\n\n  \n    A man convinced against his will,\n\n    Is of the same opinion still.\n  \n\n\nHow to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:\n\n  Welcome the disagreement\n  Distrust your first instinctive impression\n  Control your temper\n  Listen first\n  Look for areas of agreement\n  Be honest\n  Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully\n  Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest\n  Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem\n\n\nPrinciple 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\n\nA Sure Way of Making Enemies; and How to Avoid It\n\n\n  Men must be taught as if you taught them not,\nAnd things unknown proposed as things forgot.\n\n  Alexander Pope\n\n\n\n  Men You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.\n\n  Galileo\n\n\n\n  One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.\n\n  Socrates\n\n\nInstead of stating the fact of others’ incorrectness, posit that the possibility exists of your mistakenness, and proceed from there.\n\nPrinciple 2: Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”\n\nIf You’re Wrong, Admit It\n\n\n  If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn’t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?\n\n\nThe best thing to do is to admit it quickly and emphatically.\nThe next best thing to do is to admit it emphatically.\n\nPrinciple 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.\n\nA Drop of Honey\n\n\n  If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.\n\n  Abraham Lincoln\n\n\n\n  If I had tried the methods the other tenants were using, I am positive I should have met with the same failure they encountered. It was the friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach that won.\n\n\n\n  Remembering the principles, I decided that showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile purpose.\n\n\nPrinciple 4: Begin in a friendly way\n\nThe Secret of Socrates\n\n\n  Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative direction.\n\n  The more “Yeses” we can get at the very outset, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention of our ultimate proposal.\n\n\nYou can get people to agree fairly readily on one of two things\n\n  Hard Mode: Common ground\n  Easy Mode: Your representation of their point of view and/or interests\n  Training Wheels: Objective facts\n\n\nOld Chinese Proverb: “He who treads softly goes far.”\n\nPrinciple 5: Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately\n\nThe Safety Valve in Handling Complaints\n\n\n  Let the other people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do.\n\n\nYou get to do this by asking clarifying questions. Keep in mind that the problems that you thought they had might not be the ones that they are most concerned with. By letting them talk themselves out, you are allowing them to dig deep and reveal their true concerns and cares.\n\nPrinciple 6: Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.\n\nHow to get cooperation\n\n\n  Don’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter?\nIf so, isn’t it bad judgement to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people?\nIsn’t it wiser to make suggestions, and let the other person think out the conclusion?\n\n\nPrinciple 7: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.\n\nA Formula That Will Work Wonders For You\n\n\n  Remember that other people may be totally wrong.\nBut they don’t think so.\nDon’t condemn them.\nAny fool can do that.\nTry to understand them.\nOnly wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.\n\n  There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does.\nFerret out that reason, and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.\n\n  Try to put yourself in his place.\n\n\n\n  Seeing things through another person’s eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become overwhelming.\n\n\n\n  Tomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your favorite charity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another person’s point of view.\nAsk yourself: “Why should he or she want to do it?”\nTrue, this will take time, but it will avoid making enemies and will get better results, and with less friction.\n\n\n\n  I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person, from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives, was likely to answer.\n\n\nPrinciple 8: Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.\n\nWhat Everybody Wants\n\nHere is a magic phrase that:\n\n  Stops arguments\n  Eliminates ill feeling\n  Creates good will\n  Makes the other person listen attentively\n\n\n\n  I don’t blame you one bit for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\n\n\nYou deserve very little credit for being what you are.\nRemember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are.\nFeel sorry for them; pity them and sympathize with them.\nSay to yourself: “There, but for the grace of God, go I.”\nMost of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy.\nGive it to them, and they will love you.\n\nPrinciple 9: Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires\n\nAn Appeal That Everybody Likes\n\nA person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good, and a real reason.\n\n\n  People are honest and want to discharge their obligations.\nThe exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair.\n\n\nPrinciple 10: Appeal to the nobler motives\n\nThe Movies Do It, TV Does It, Why Don’t You Do It?\n\nMerely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting and dramatic. You have to use showmanship.\n\nPrinciple 11: Dramatize your ideas.\n\nWhen Nothing Else Works, Try This\n\nCharles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren’t producing their quota of work…\n\n\n  The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.\n\n\nPrinciple 12: Throw down a challenge\n",

When somebody calls you on the telephone use the same psychology. Say “Hello” in tones that bespeak how pleased YOU are to have the person call. Many companies train their telephone operators to greet all callers in a tone of voice that radiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is concerned about them. Let’s remember that when we answer the telephone tomorrow.\n\nWe are interested in others when they are interested in us.\n\nPrinciple 1- Become genuinely interested in other people.\n\nA simple way to make a good first impression\n\nThe effect of a smile is powerful - even when it’s unseen. “Your smile comes through in your voice.”\n\n\n  The chairman of the board of directors of one of the largest rubber companies ‘in the United States told me that, according to his observations, people rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.\n\n\n\n  had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. Later, I saw those people change as the fun became work. The business had grown dull, They lost all joy in it, and they failed.” You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.\n\n\nYou don’t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James put it:\n\n“Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n\n“Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. . . .”\n\nEvery body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.\n\nPrinciple 2 - Smile\n\nIf you don’t do this you are headed for trouble\n\nPRINCIPLE 3 -Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\n\nAn easy way to be a good conversationalist\n\nI’ve never been to Africa…\n\nA person’s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4 -Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\n\nHow to interest people\n\nEveryone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge. Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say. And how was it done? The answer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.\n\nFor Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.\n\nPrinciple 5 - Talk in terms of the other person’s interestes.\n\nHow to make people like you instantly\n\nDog Breeder Example. Guy won all these prizes for breeding. Man continued to ask questions, and more questions, and eventually the breeder asked if the man wanted a dog for his son.\n\nMake the other person feel important, and do it sincerely.\n",

But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving\n\n  \n    Benjamin Franklin\n  \n\n\nPrinciple 1: Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.\n\nThe Big Secret of Dealing with People\n\nThere is only one way to get anybody to do anything; and that is by making the other person want to do it.\n\n\n  The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important\n\n  \n    Dr. John Dewey\n  \n\n\n\n  There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors.\nI never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work.\nSo I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault.\nIf I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.\n\n  \n    Charles Schwab\n  \n\n\nA note on flattery:\n\n\n  It seldom works with discerning people.\nIt is shallow, selfish and insincere.\nIt ought to fail and usually does.\n\n\nPrinciple 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation\n\nThis is all about setting expectations and developing a standard.\nThis can only be provided after the fact, and is not a way to proactively make the other person want to do it.\nRather, this is a long-term strategy to encourage an environment in which excellence receives honest and sincere appreciation.\n\nHe Who Can Do This Has the Whole World with Him. He Who Cannot Walks a Lonely Way\n\n\n  I often went fishing up to Maine during the summer.\nPersonally, I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms.\n\n\n…fill in the rest.\n\n\n  Why talk about what we want?\nThat is childish and absurd.\nOf course you are interested in what you want; you are eternally interested in it.\nBut no one else is.\nThe rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.\n\n\nThe only way on earth to influence other people is to:\n\n  Talk about what they want\n  Show them how to get it\n\n\n\n  Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire.\nAnd the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want.\nHe who can do this has the whole world with him.\nHe who cannot walks a lonely way.\n\n  \n    Harry A. Overstreet\n  \n\n\n\n  If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.\n\n  \n    Owen D. Young\n  \n\n\nPrinciple 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want\n\nHere we get to some actionable, practical, implementable advice.\nHowever, it is much harder than it sounds on the surface.\nThis is not something that can be automated, or is really even cookie-cutter.\nThis is not something that can be gleaned from a 5-minute surface discussion.\nThis advice is best implemented for short-term convincing between two people who are able to take the time and energy to dive deep into each other’s wants and needs.\nAdditionally, this cannot be treated as a simple carrot and stick, as was described above, the fundamental want in people is to be important.\nThis will not work simply with material things, but rather the want must arise from the deep-seated convictions of what is already there.\n",

The truth is down there somewhere, but it’s fragile. While each blow with your shovel gets you closer to the truth, you’re liable to smash it into a million little pieces if  you use too blunt an instrument.”\n\nPeople say you shouldn’t ask your mom whether your business is a good idea. That’s technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn’t ask anyone whether your business is a good idea. At least not in those words. Your mom will lie to you the most (just ‘cuz she loves you), but it’s a bad question and invites everyone to lie to you at least a little. It’s not anyone else’s responsibility to show us the truth. It’s our responsibility to find it. We do that by asking good questions.\n\n1) Talk about their life instead of your idea\n2) Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future\n3) Talk less and listen more\n\nThere are 3 types of Bad data:\n\n  Compliments\n    \n      Deflect Compliments, you want facts and commitments, not compliments\n      Avoid them completely by not mentioning your idea\n    \n  \n  Fluff\n    \n      The world’s most deadly fluff is: “I would definitely buy that.”\n      As a founder you want to believe its money in the bank, but folks are wildly optimistic about what they would do in the future. They are always more positive, excited, and willing to pay in the imagined future than they are once it arrives.\n      Worst kind of question is “Would you ever..?” Of course they might.. That doesn’t mean they will.\n      Ask for concrete examples.. instead of “do you ever X?” ask “When’s the last time that happened?”\n    \n  \n  Ideas\n    \n      Write them down but don’t rush to add them to the “todo list”\n      When you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the motivations which led to it. Dig.\n    \n  \n\n\nTo get toward the truth, you need to reject their generic claims, and fluffy promises. Instead, anchor them towards the life they already lead and the actions they are already taking.\n\nSelling a pain-killer (solves problem now) vs a Vitamin (nice to have). Asking “Does -this-matter-problem” questions:\n\n  “How serious do you take this?”\n  “Do you make money from it?”\n  “How much time do you spend per week on this”\n  “Which tools/services do you use for it?”\n  “What are you doing to improve it?”\n\n\nPrepare your list of 3\n\nAlways pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any given type of person.\n\nFocus on the three questions which seem murkiest or most important right now.\n\nLearning from customers doesn’t mean you have to be wearing a suit and drinking boardroom coffee. Asking the right questions is fast and touches on topics people find quite interesting.\n\nRule of Thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favor by talking to you, it’s probably too formal.\n\nEarly conversations are very fast. The chats grow longer as you move from the early broad questions “Is this a real problem” toward more specific product and industry issues “Which other software do we have to integrate with to close the sale?”\n\n",

You’re not gunna sign into Kanboard if you hate it!\n\n\nThis is more important than ever when adopting new tooling and changing the day-to-day functions of an organization, no matter how small it is!!!\n\nWhen someone considers their task as completed, but to your point of view, it’s only 1/5 completed, then you have a problem. Some recent examples:\n\n\n  Network Engineer Spinning up Windows DB Server\n  Why do we write documentation?\n\n\nThis is in no small part a lack of setting expectations. Using Kanboard, you can do this using the description field of a task.\n\nThis can also come back to the three components of motivation:\n\n\n  Autonomy\n  Mastery\n  Purpose\n\n\nRelationship Management - Everything\n\nIn response to “It’s like a physical tick for me to be unable to lie”:\n\n\n  Sometimes things need to be said in a diplomatic way, and not just… bleh, you know?\n\n  […]\n\n  How do you decide, or do you decide how this is going to make this person feel.\n\n  […]\n\n  If I heard “There’s probably some misunderstanding between us. Let me be as clear and precise as possible to clear away that misunderstanding”, I would be like, ooh… too clear.\n\n  Just Chatting on Twitch\n\n\n\n  People need to feel heard. They need to not feel this is just another top down thing.\nTo get buy-in, people love to interact with ideas before it is set in stone.\nThis will make them feel heard and valued.\nIt will also allow us to gain valuable insights into potential misunderstandings before an official rollout.\nFinally, by drawing them into the process before completion they will feel an ownership of it because they touched it before it was finalized.\n(This remains true even if the tool is 99.9% complete.)\nWithout buy-in, you are trying to lead people where they don’t want to go.\nTaking time to get buy-in is like taking time to show people a travel brochure and letting people get excited about the journey.\nIf the goal is buyin, the extra time it takes is worth the years of positive movement.\nWhen it comes to change, efficient is not always effective.\nHeather Farran’s Write-up and Evaluation\n\n\n\n  Historically, RMS has been expressing his views in ways that upset many people.\nHe is usually more focused on the philosophical underpinnings, and pursuing the objective truth and linguistic purism, while underemphasising people’s feelings on matters he’s commenting on.\nThis makes his arguments vulnerable to misunderstanding and misrepresentation, something which we feel is happening in the open letter calling for his removal.\nHis words need to be interpreted in this context and taking into account that more often than not, he is not looking to put things diplomatically.\n\n  An Open Letter in Support of Richard M. Stallman\n\n",

No man willingly permits the thief to rob his bins of grain. Nor does any man willingly permit an enemy to drive away his customers and rob him of his profits. When once I did recognize that such acts as these my enemy was committing, with determination I conquered him. So must every man master his own spirit of procrastination before he can expect to share in the rich treasures of Babylon.\n\n  \n    The Richest Man in Babylon\n  \n\n\nIn other words:\n\n\n  Normally, people are assigned tasks in your meeting\n  People delay taking action on these tasks until just before the next meeting\n  This causes a spike in productivity right before the meeting\n  Therefore, to the degree you increase the meeting frequency, you create that spike of activity more often.\n\n\nThe frequency is the correct timing and consistent agenda to accomplish 4 things:\n\n\n  Make sure everything is on-track\n  Stay on the same page with your team\n  Hold each other accountable\n  Solve issues\n\n\nMeeting Roles\n\n\n  Meeting Faciliator\n    \n      Runs the meeting\n      Move team through agenda\n      Keep everything on track\n    \n  \n  Document Manager/Scribe\n    \n      Manages the documents\n      Maintains lists of tasks/projects\n      Documents any decisions agreed-upon\n      Notes any blocking requirements\n      Marks down any commitments made to accomplish tasks\n    \n  \n\n\nThe two above roles must be assumed by 2 different people\n\nMeeting Sections\n\n\n  Intro &amp; Segue\n    \n      Start on time\n      Take the first 5 minutes to Segue\n        \n          Transition away from day-to-day battles\n          It is suggested to share good news, personal and/or professional\n          Helps humanize the process\n          Allows team members to get to know each other better\n          starts the meeting off with a positive vibe\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Conclusion\n    \n      HARD stop with 5 minutes left to complete remaining sections:\n        \n          Recap the TODO list that resulted from the meeting discussion\n          Decide the direction for follow-up outside of the team that is required\n            \n              What the message is\n              Who will deliver it\n            \n          \n          Rate the meeting on a scale of 1-10 based on:\n            \n              Did it start and end on time?\n              Did you follow the agenda?\n              Is everyone on the same page?\n              Did 90% or more of the TODOs get done?\n              Did you solve the most important issues?\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nChapter 7 - What’s My Number?\n\n\n  Imaging yourself playing a sport and you can’t see the scoreboard. You don’t know the score; the referees will not tell you when you commit a foul or penalty; you don’t know how much time is left on the clock. You’re not sure if you’re winning or losing, and the frustrated coach keeps telling you, “Just play harder.”\n\n\nConsequences:\n\n  Wasted Time\n  Poor Resource Allocation\n  Weak Overall Performance\n  Terrible Results\n\n\nWhy should every employee have a number?\n\n  Numbers cut through murky subjective communication between manager and employee\n  Numbers create accountability\n  Accountable people appreciate numbers\n  Numbers create clarity and commitment\n  Numbers create competition\n  Numbers produce results\n  Numbers create teamwork\n  Numbers solve problems faster\n\n\nMetrics\n\nAliases:\n\n  Dashboard\n  Flash Report\n  Pulse Report\n  KPI (Key Performance Indicators)\n  Scorecards\n\n\nDifferent Levels Have Different Amounts of Metrics\n\n  Company: 5-15\n  Department: 3-5\n\n\nWhat Gets Measured, Gets Done\n\nRandom Rationale:\n\n  Metrics should be on activity-based leading indicators. That means they measure current activity that produces future results.\n  Scorecards should display the last 13 weeks-worth of data at a glance in order to identify patterns and trends.\n  The individual and the department metrics should have the same measurables reported on\n    \n      The department metrics should simply be the aggregate of the individuals’ that comprise it.\n    \n  \n\n",

As long as the API of a platform is available, ChatOps services will allow the functionality of the desired application.\n  All the necessary tools are at their fingertips and they can now be operated from within the chat windows using bots and other commands instead of opening a dedicated application window or console.\n\n\nIncident Management Toolchain\n\nChatOps doesn’t replace the available tool, it simply makes them more accessible to everyone involved. The benefit of ChatOps comes by reducing the context switches between the tools and allowing you to work with one central tool. Why open a browser when you can pull the dashboard into the chatroom? Why be alerted by (yet another) e-mail when you can join the incident chatroom?\n\n\n  Better Living Through Chatops\n  PagerDuty - What is Chatops\n\n\nIntegrations\n\nIf you have an interest in getting chatops setup\n\n\n  Gitlab\n  Matrix\n\n",

The concepts are pretty simple, but they are by no means obvious.\n\n\nYou’re not paying attention. Nobody is.\nIt’s not your fault. It’s just physically impossible for you to pay attention to everything the markets expect you to.\n\nSomeone in an airport walks up to you and asks you where gate 7 is. Obviously you weren’t hoping for, or expecting, someone to come up and ask this question, but since he looks nice enought, you point him in the right direction. Now imagine the same airport, but its three in the afternoon and youre late for your flight. Youve already been approached 5 times, odds are your response will be a lot different. You might ignore them all together. What if he’s the 5th, 10th, 50th, 100th person to do this. Sooner or later it all becomes background noise.\n\nThe problem is, that marketers have responded to this problem with the single worst cure possible. To deal with the clutter and the diminished effectieness of Interruption Marketing, they are interrupting us even more.\n\nConsumers are spending less time seeking alternative solutions\n\nPeople don’t need to care as much as they used to. The quality of products has increased dramatically. Ninety years ago we made stuff, we didn’t buy it.\n\nProblems with interruption Marketing\n\n  Human beings have a finite amount of attention\n  Human beings have a finite amount of money\n  The more products offered, the less money there is to go around\n  In order to capture more attention and more money, Interruption Marketers must increase spending\n  But this increase in marketing costs big money\n  Spending more and more money in order to get bigger returns leads to even more clutter\n  Catch22 The more they spend, the less it works. The less it works the more they spend.\n\n\nPermissive Marketing\n\nBut in today’s free market, there are plenty of factories, plenty of brands, and way too many choices.\nWith just a little effort and a little savings, we can get almost anything we want.\n\nNeed two things in order to have an economy: people who want things, and scarcity of the thing they want.\n\nPermissive marketing: offers the consumer an opportunity to volunteer to be marketed to. It allows marketers to tell their story more calmly and succinctly without fear of being interrupted by competitors or Interruption Marketers. It serves both consumers and marketers in a symbiotic exchange.\n\nThe five steps to dating your customer:\n\n  Offer the prospect an incentive to volunteer\n  Using the attention offered by the prospect, offer a curriculum over time, teaching the consumer about your product or service.\n  Reinforce the incentive to guarantee that the prospect maintains the permission.\n  Offer additional incentives to get even more permission from the customer.\n  Over time, leverage the permission to change consumer behavior toward profits.\n\n\nPermission Marketing requires patience.\n\nRandom\n\nA single ad is not enough to sell a product. (5)\n\nMarketing guru Jay Levinson figures you have to run an ad 27 times against one individual before it has its desired impact. Why? Because only one out of nine sinks in, and youve got to see if at least three times before it sinks in.\n",

But find yourself working inside the black box and you will be in need of guidance.\n  Once a team is set up, what should it do? What process should it use? How should it be held accountable to performance milestones?\n    Learn\n    VALUE VS WASTE\n  \n  Which of our efforts are value-creating and which are wasteful?\n    VALIDATED LEARNING:\n  \n  Positive changes in metrics became the quantitative validation that our learning was real.\n  Everything a startup does is understood to be an experiment designed to achieve validated learning\n  If the numbers from such early experiments don’t look promising, there is clearly a problem with the strategy. That doesn’t mean it’s time to give up; on the contrary, it means it’s time to get some immediate qualitative feedback about the program.\n  Value in a startup is not the creation of stuff, but rather validated learning about how to build a sustainable business.\n    Leap\n  \n  These two hypotheses represent two of the most important leap-of-faith questions any new startup faces:\n    \n      rate of growth\n      retention rate (come-back rate)\n        STRATEGY IS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS\n      \n    \n  \n  The first step in understanding a new product or service is to figure out if it is fundamentally value-creating or value-destroying. I use the language of economics in referring to value.\n    Test\n  \n  Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.\n    WHY FIRST PRODUCTS AREN’T MEANT TO BE PERFECT\n  \n  Before new products can be sold successfully to the mass market, they have to be sold to early adopters. These people are a special breed of customer. They accept—in fact prefer—an 80 percent solution; you don’t need a perfect solution to capture their interest\n  Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing.\n    THE ROLE OF QUALITY AND DESIGN IN AN MVP\n  \n  Most modern business and engineering philosophies focus on producing high-quality experiences for customers as a primary principle; These discussions of quality presuppose that the company already knows what attributes of the product the customer will perceive as worthwhile.\n  If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is.\n    Measure\n  \n  A startup’s job is to:\n    \n      Rigorously measure where (the product) is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then\n      Devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan.\n        WHY SOMETHING AS SEEMINGLY DULL AS ACCOUNTING WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE\n      \n    \n  \n  I make a habit of asking startups whenever we meet: are you making your product better? They always say yes. Then I ask: how do you know?\n  To answer these kinds of questions, startups have a strong need for a new kind of accounting geared specifically to disruptive innovation. That’s what innovation accounting is.\n    HOW INNOVATION ACCOUNTING WORKS—THREE LEARNING MILESTONES\n  \n  Innovation accounting works in three steps:\n    \n      First, use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now.\n      Second, startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal.\n      Third: a decision needs to be made whether to pivot or persevere\n        OPTIMIZATION VERSUS LEARNING\n      \n    \n  \n  A startup has to measure progress against a high bar: evidence that a sustainable business can be built around its products or services.\n    VANITY METRICS: A WORD OF CAUTION\n  \n  Innovation accounting will not work if a startup is being misled by these kinds of vanity metrics: gross number of customers and so on. The alternative is the kind of metrics we use to judge our business and our learning milestones, what I call actionable metrics.\n    THE VALUE OF THE THREE A’S\n  \n  Actionable\n    \n      When cause and effect is clearly understood, people are better able to learn from their actions. Human beings are innately talented learners when given a clear and objective assessment.\n    \n  \n  Accessible\n    \n      Cohort-based reports are the gold standard of learning metrics: they turn complex actions into people-based reports.\n    \n  \n  Auditable\n    \n      Instead of housing the analytics or data in a separate system, reporting data and its infrastructure should be considered part of the product itself and owned by the product development team.\n        INNOVATION ACCOUNTING LEADS TO FASTER PIVOTS\n        Accelerate\n        Batch\n        SMALL BATCHES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n      \n    \n  \n  The theory that is the foundation of Toyota’s success can be used to dramatically improve the speed at which startups find validated learning.\n  In the Lean Startup the goal is not to produce more stuff efficiently. It is to, as quickly as possible, learn how to build a sustainable business.\n  By reducing batch size, we can get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop more quickly than our competitors can.\n    PULL, DON’T PUSH\n  \n  This creates a “hole”, which automatically causes a signal to be sent\n  This is the famous Toyota just-in-time production method\n  Our goal in building products is to be able to run experiments that will help us learn how to build a sustainable business.\n  The right way to think about the product development process in a Lean Startup is that it is responding to pull requests in the form of experiments that need to be run.\n  Thus, it is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is waste.\n    Grow\n    WHERE DOES GROWTH COME FROM?\n  \n  The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth.\n  Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers.\n  There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth:\n    \n      Word of mouth\n      As a side effect of (public) product usage.\n      Through funded advertising\n      Through repeat purchase or use\n        THE THREE ENGINES OF GROWTH\n      \n    \n  \n  One of the most expensive forms of potential waste for a startup is spending time arguing about how to prioritize new development once it has a product on the market.\nStartups have to focus on the big experiments that lead to validated learning. The engines of growth framework helps them stay focused on the metrics that matter.\n  Sticky\n    \n      rely on having a high customer retention rate\n      track their attrition rate or churn rate very carefully\n      if the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the product will grow\n      In the sticky engine of growth, they are better suited to testing the value hypothesis: that customers find the product valuable\n    \n  \n  Viral\n    \n      depend on person-to-person transmission as a necessary consequence of normal product use\n    \n  \n  Paid\n    \n      you need to know only one thing: how much it costs to sign up a new customer\n    \n  \n  more than one engine of growth can operate in a business at a time\n    MARKET FIT\n  \n  Describes the moment when a startup finally finds a widespread set of customers that resonate with its product\n  A startup can evaluate whether it is getting closer to product/market fit as it tunes its engine by evaluating each trip through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop using innovation accounting.\n    WHEN ENGINES RUN OUT\n  \n  every engine of growth eventually runs out of gas. Every engine is tied to a given set of customers and their related habits, preferences, advertising channels, and interconnections. At some point, that set of customers will be exhausted.\n    Adapt\n  \n  Having no system at all is not an option.\n    THE WISDOM OF THE FIVE WHYS\n  \n  The core idea of Five Whys is to tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms.\n  The system takes its name from the investigative method of asking the question “Why?” five times to understand what has happened (the root cause).\n  At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem.\n  By asking and answering “why” five times, we can get to the real cause of the problem, which is often hidden behind more obvious symptoms.\n    THE CURSE OF THE FIVE BLAMES\n  \n  When the Five Whys approach goes awry, I call it the Five Blames.\n  I ask teams to adopt these simple rules:\n    \n      Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time.\n      Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  I have noticed this pattern every time: switching to validated learning feels worse before it feels better. That’s the case because the problems caused by the old system tend to be intangible, whereas the problems of the new system are all too tangible. Having the benefit of theory is the antidote to these challenges. If it is known that this loss of productivity is an inevitable part of the transition, it can be managed actively.\n\n",

DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), and it seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology — especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.\n-Gartner\n\n\n\n  DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.\n\n\nYou build it, you run it.\n\nKey point being it brings developers in contact with the day-to-day operation of their software.\n\nPractices in the Context of Devops:\n\n  Infrastructure Automation - describing your infrastructure and its configuration as a script or set of scripts so that environments can be replicated in a much less error-prone manner\n  Continuous Integration - focus on merging changes into master branch using automated tooling and checks to validate code\n  Continuous Delivery - an extension of CI that focus’s on the release\n  Continuous Monitoring - collect and analyze data from the infrastructure (hardware, network, application) and to leverage the data to improve business results\n\n\nThere becomes a breakdown of the “Silos” between the operations team and the development team. Usually we see the dev team as the “makers” and the operations team as “the people who deal with creation after birth.”\n\n\n  DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use many of the same techniques as developers for their systems work.\n\n\nOne Word, Velocity.\n\nThe main idea behind velocity is to help teams estimate how much work they can complete in a given time period based on how quickly similar work was previously completed.\n\nMore Info\n\n  Atlassian - What is Devops\n  Atlassian - You Build it You Run It\n  Atlassian - CI CD\n  IBM - Infrastructure Automation\n  AWS - What is devops\n  New Relic - What is Devops\n  Guru99 - Agile vs Devops\n  Buzzword Abuse\n\n",

We obsessively seek out elegant, composable abstractions that enable robust, scalable, flexible integrations. Because we eliminate needless complexity and extraneous details, you can get up and running with Stripe in just a couple of minutes.\n\n\nOne of the features I really like is the granular control over pricing plans. \nWith Stripe’s flexibility we are able to add one time charges, recurring charges, usage-based charges, tiered pricing, promotions and trial periods, and adjustable billing frequency.\n\nCheck out Stripe billing for more information.\n\nOurComposeCast Donations - Memberful powered by Stripe\n\nMemberful is a tool we use to accept monthly and one-time donations on our jekyll (static) site.\n\nMemberful integrates with our already existing Stripe account and does all the legwork for us. \nI would describe it as a tool built on Stripe for CMS’s (Content Management Systems) and static sites.\n\nCommandCenter - Stripe Embedded\n\nCommandcenter is a React/Ruby on Rails application we use to manage customers and billing.\nRuby uses “gems” to manage dependencies, and Stripe has a gem that gives our application the ability to handle payments within the site using Stripe’s billing and payment services.\n\nWe also use React to customize our front end and the react-stripe-elements library to make the payment form you see pretty.\n\nCheck out Accepting a Payment and the Integration Builder for more information on how Stripe handles payments.\n",

This approach integrates its own unique insights together with the best thinking from resources like David Allen’s Getting Things Done and Stephen Covey’s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, on a gospel-centered foundation.\n\n(Ch. 17) Delegation\n\nWe don’t have all the time we need to do what needs to get done. But we have all the resources that we need to get everything done. We need other people too!\n\nDelegation won’t just get rid of unwanted tasks. Important tasks need to be delegated too.\n\nDelegation is a way of serving those you delegate to by building them up. This is stewardship delegation vs gopher delegation. Stewardship includes an area of responsibility, where gopher is a wait until told state.\n\n5 Components of effective delegation:\n\n\n  Desired Results\n  Guidelines\n  Resources\n  Accountability\n  Consequences\n\n\nSaying that some can’t handle stewardship is selling them short.\n\n(Ch. 20) Managing Email and Workflow\n\nThe amount of info we have to process can overwhelm us.\n\nStep 1: Collect\n\nHave a capture tool everywhere. And make sure it’s one that you like to use.\n\nStep 2: Process\n\n\n  Process in order (of time rec’d)\n  Process one item at a time\n  Never put anything back into your inbox\n\n\nThe two questions to ask:\n\n\n  What is this\n  What’s the next action\n\n\nStep 3: Organize and act\n\nThere are 5 possible things to do with a source of input:\n\n\n  Delete it\n  File it\n  Do it\n  Delegate it\n  Defer it\n\n\n1-2 are when no action is required. 3 is when it can be done quickly (90 seconds or less). 4-5 are when further action is required.\n\nThe problem with the two-minute rule:\n\n\n  If done on a continual basis, there is a nonzero chance that you will receive 2-minute input faster than you can process it. This can be combatted by instituting time blocking and turning off email. As mentioned before, this should be in 90 minute increments. Once per day should be enough.\n\n\nSee: What is Inbox Zero, and How Can You Achieve It?\n\n(Ch. 18) Harnessing the Time Killers\n\nEliminate or harness them.\n\nMultitasking: Killing it\n\nMultitasking is actually switchtasking. Switch tasking incurs context switching costs. Background tasking requires one or none of the tasks use focus. Rapid refocusing is completing tasks in quick succession that only require seconds to complete.\n\nProcrastination: Harnessing it\n\nLove what you do. The three components of motivation are:\n\n\n  Autonomy\n  Mastery\n  Purpose\n\n\nIf you’re still procrastinating, try:\n\n\n  Identifying missing information or precedent tasks\n  Breaking it down into smaller chunks\n  Do nothing (literally, for a period of time)\n\n\nInterruptions: Making them Beneficial\n\nMinimize them when possible. Otherwise have uninterruptible periods of solo work time, and making yourself available outside of those times. Consider interruptions little gifts from God.\n",

The base reproducibility allows us to easily spin up new instances of services for every new customer that joins the platform.\n\nWith the use of Docker volumes we are also able to easily manage storage among our containers and keep data persistent.\n\nUsing the docker network, we are able to spin up an NGINX container as a frontend server, call it our proxy server to our other containers and use the internal Docker network to communicate among containers.\n\nThis means we are able to run all our applications off of port 80 and 443 at subfolders such as /nextcloud and /kanboard.\n\nImages and Pipelines\n\nRails Example Dockerfile\n\nWith this Rails image, after I defined the container requirements from a runtime perspective I was able to use Gitlab pipelines to continuously test any new commits to the repo testing for breaking changes.\n\nEssentially on every commit to the project we have pipelines build the image so we can use it in our next deploy. If the build fails, rather than deploying the failed image to production we are able to look at what went wrong and fix our issue.\n\nSlimming down an Image with a MultiStage Builds\n\nWith multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don’t want in the final image.\n\nConclusion\n\nDocker isn’t going anywhere.\nWe are only going to see more usage of containers across environments in all sized organizations.\n",

It’s best to specify these explicitly so that others and your future self can understand your state of mind and thinking if they every look at it.\n\n  – DEV.to\n\n\n\n  The default path is set to PATH=/usr/bin:/bin. If the command you are executing is not present in the cron specified path, you can either use the absolute path to the command or change the cron $PATH variable.

The goal of containerization, at its core, is to offer a better way to create, package, and deploy software across different environments in a predictable and easy-to-manage way.\n\nContainers are an operating system virtualization technology used to package applications and their dependencies and run them in isolated environments. They provide a lightweight method of packaging and deploying applications in a standardized way across many different types of infrastructure.\n\nThe container format also ensures that the application dependencies are baked into the image itself, simplifying the hand off and release processes. Because the hosts and platforms that run containers are generic, infrastructure management for container-based systems can be standardized.\n\nContainers vs VMs\n\nContainers take a different approach. Rather than virtualizing the entire computer, containers virtualize the operating system directly. They run as specialized processes managed by the host operating system’s kernel, but with a constrained and heavily manipulated view of the system’s processes, resources, and environment. Containers are unaware that they exist on a shared system and operate as if they were in full control of the computer.\n\nWhat makes this technology possible - Linux Cgroups and Namespaces\n\nCgroups are a kernel feature that allow processes and their resources to be grouped, isolated, and managed as a unit. cgroups bundle processes together, determine which resources they can access, and provide a mechanism for managing and monitoring their behavior.\n\nNamespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources.\n\nWhat is Docker?\n\nDocker is a set of tools that allow users to create container images, push or pull images from external registries, and run and manage containers in many different environments.\n\nBenefits\n\n\n  Lightweight Virtualization\n  Environment Isolation\n  Standardized Packaging and Runtime Environment\n  Scalability\n\n",
